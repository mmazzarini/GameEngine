Why does cherno want to use a dll?
The Engine and everything will be linked into the game.
the game will depend onto a big single dll file
so the engine as a service for the game lets say.

SO:
- link everything into the dll of the engine
- then link engine dll into the game.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
When you create the app project (Sandbox):
Add -> R eference and put the engine as refernce.
It means that THE engine will be linked into the sandbox app.

LESSON 2
We discuss trhe entry point

we need to start somewhere! :) this is the point

also, the engine here is a dll

when the app loads/unloads the dll, we have some starting point

the gengine is a realtime app engine. but it can do more, somehbow, so
were going to provide a way for the gengine apps toi provide their own entry point.

we want the main to be taken control from the engine side.

we need to define an app inside sandbox
in quesdto vedi che ue5 fa diversamente :)


virtual ~Application();

ricorda la virtual app destructor. because the app is subclassed in sandbox
