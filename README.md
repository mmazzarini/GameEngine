# GameEngine
Repo containing a C++ game engine project based on The Cherno's Engine YT series.

Disclaimer: This is NOT an engine of my property, nor some engine I have invented by myself.
Its intention is solely self-educational. I have created the repo to follow some of Cherno's c++ engine programming lessons to learn
and dive a bit deeper into the world of C++ game engines.
All the linked/included third party libraries were added for personal educational purposes only and they do not serve
any other purpose.

For more information about the included third party libraries follow the discussions by the Cherno inside the videos in the provided link.
