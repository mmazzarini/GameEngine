# GameEngine
Repo containing a C++ game engine project based on the Cherno Engine YT series.

Disclaimer: This is NOT an engine of my property, nor some engine I have invented by myself.
Its intention was educational. I have created the repo to follow some of Cherno's c++ engine programming lessons to learn
and dive a bit deeper into the world of C++ game engines.
All the linked/included third party libraries were added for personal educational purposes only and they do not serve
any other purpose.
